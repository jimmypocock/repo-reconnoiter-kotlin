# Sentry Configuration Example (LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
# Copy this file to sentry.properties and fill in your actual values
# sentry.properties is gitignored and will not be committed
#
# NOTE: This file is only used for LOCAL Gradle builds (./gradlew bootJar)
#       Docker builds use SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN from .env instead (more secure)

# Auth Token - Get from: https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
# Required permissions: project:releases, project:write
# Used at BUILD TIME to upload source code for better stack traces
# Note: Token contains URL/org/project info, so no need to specify separately
auth.token=YOUR_SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
